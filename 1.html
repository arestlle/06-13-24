      Dear PAPA,  
      Let me start my greeting with an expression of gratitude. I want to thank you for
       being a good father to us, a father who is always there to support, guide, and correct 
       us. I want to thank you for providing for all our needs, no matter how small or big 
       they are. The same goes for providing me and Coco with supervision and care whenever 
       we are sick. Those were the times that we needed you the most, and you were always there,
        so thank you. I also want to express my gratitude for the continuous support for my studies 
        and everyday needs in school. I know these are the words that we rarely say to you, but we 
        mean them every time we do. We are not very vocal with these, so we hope that through this
         letter we are able to express them to you. Also, I would like to say sorry for everything 
         we have done that has upset and disappointed you. In return, we would like to make up for
          them in other ways, such as by dedicating our achievements in school to you. Everything 
          I and Coco have achieved, we all dedicate to you. We acknowledge your sacrifice for us, 
          papa, and for that, we thank you.
       Happy happy birthday, papa. We wish you good health and many more birthdays to come. 
       We love you.<div class="w3-row">
